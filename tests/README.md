# Tests

| Directory | What | Run with |
|---|---|---|
| `lua-5.5/` | The official Lua 5.5 test suite, vendored, with a manifest and documented skips | `cargo testkit conformance` |
| `diff/` | Small programs whose output must match the reference `lua5.5` exactly | `cargo testkit diff` |
| `../bench/` | Benchmarks: time, peak RSS, binary size | `cargo testkit bench` |
| `diff/compat/` | Lua 5.5 feature programs for the compatibility plan, diffed like `diff/` | `cargo testkit diff --corpus tests/diff/compat` |

`cargo testkit fuzz-syntax` compiles seeded mutants of the suite and the corpora with both interpreters and compares the compile errors. It fails only on mismatches missing from [`fuzz/syntax-mismatches.txt`](fuzz/syntax-mismatches.txt); refresh that list with `--update-expected` when a change fixes some.

`cargo testkit scoreboard` runs all of it at once and prints the compatibility picture: which suite files compile, pass, or how far they get, and how each corpus compares with `lua5.5`. [`docs/compat/scoreboard.md`](../docs/compat/scoreboard.md) records it over time.

All three are driven by `orbit-testkit` (`crates/orbit-testkit`), which runs interpreters as subprocesses, so it tests `orbit` and the reference `lua5.5` the same way. `cargo testkit` is an alias for `cargo run --release -p orbit-testkit --`; every command takes `--help`.

GitHub CI runs all three, but its automatic runs are paused for now (see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`), so run them locally before pushing. The reference interpreter is built from source by `scripts/build-reference-lua.sh` into `target/reference-lua/` (it needs git and a C compiler).

## Expected-pass lists

`orbit` passes almost nothing yet, so CI doesn't require every test to pass. Instead `lua-5.5/expected-orbit.txt` and `diff/expected-orbit.txt` list what `orbit` is known to pass, and CI fails when a listed test stops passing. When a change makes more tests pass, the run prints them; add them with `--update-expected` in the same PR. The reference interpreter has no list: it must pass everything, which is what keeps the harness honest.

## Differential tests

Each `diff/*.lua` file runs under both interpreters. Exit status, standard output and the error message must be identical, after three normalizations: the program name at the start of an uncaught-error message becomes `lua`, the stack traceback is dropped, and addresses such as `table: 0x55d0c2a3b2c0` become `0xADDR`. Tests must be deterministic, so don't depend on `pairs` order, `os.time`, `math.random` without a seed, or GC timing.

```sh
cargo testkit diff --reference target/reference-lua/bin/lua5.5 --interp target/release/orbit
```

Add a file whenever a behavior is subtle enough that a unit test might encode the wrong expectation: the reference interpreter decides.

## Differential fuzzing

`cargo testkit fuzz` generates random library calls, runs each batch under both interpreters and stops at the first call whose results or error differ. The targets are `format` (`string.format` specs and arguments), `pattern` (`find`, `match` and `gsub`), `pack` (`string.pack`, `unpack` and `packsize`) and `utf8`, or `all` for every one. Generators favor edge cases: limits of widths and precisions, halfway floats, malformed patterns, odd integer sizes and alignments, and invalid UTF-8.

```sh
cargo testkit fuzz --reference target/reference-lua/bin/lua5.5 --interp target/release/orbit all
```

A mismatch prints the call, both outputs and the `--seed` that reproduces the batch, and keeps the batch script under `target/testkit/fuzz`. Without `--seed` each run uses a new seed. Turn a real mismatch into a line in a `tests/diff` program once it's fixed.

## Profile-guided builds

`cargo testkit pgo` builds `target/pgo/orbit`, a release build optimized with a profile of how `orbit` actually runs. It uses rustc's stable flags in three steps:

1. It builds an instrumented `orbit` with `-Cprofile-generate` in the `pgo-gen` Cargo profile (`target/pgo-gen/orbit`). Only this throwaway binary carries the counters.
2. It runs that binary over the training set: the benchmarks at their quick inputs, `tests/diff`, `tests/diff/compat` and `tests/first-light`. Then it merges the raw profiles with `llvm-profdata`.
3. It builds `orbit` again with `-Cprofile-use` in the `pgo` profile. This is an ordinary release build. Its inlining and code layout follow the profile, and it has no instrumentation.

Both profiles inherit `release`, so `target/release/orbit` and its build cache stay as they are. `llvm-profdata` must come from the same LLVM as rustc: run `rustup component add llvm-tools`, or point `LLVM_PROFDATA` at a matching copy.

To time a benchmark the profile has never seen, leave it out of training with `--exclude fib.lua`. Two runs don't give byte-identical binaries, because counts from GC- and clock-dependent programs vary a little.
